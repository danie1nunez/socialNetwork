# Social Network API

## Description

This project is a comprehensive RESTful API designed for a social network web application. It allows users to interact in various ways similar to popular social networking platforms. Key features include:

- **User Management**: Users can create accounts, update their profiles, and delete their accounts. They can also add or remove friends, which helps in building a friend network.
- **Thought Sharing**: Users can share their thoughts or posts, which can be viewed by other users. Each thought includes a message and a timestamp.
- **Reactions to Thoughts**: Users can react to thoughts with emojis or other reactions, enabling them to express their feelings about the posts.
- **Friend List Management**: Users can manage their list of friends by sending or removing friend requests, which reflects their social connections on the platform.

The API is built using **Express.js** for routing, **MongoDB** for data storage, and **Mongoose** as an ODM to interact with the MongoDB database. It supports various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and complex interactions between users, thoughts, and reactions.

The goal of this project is to provide a robust and scalable API that can serve as the backend for a dynamic social networking application. It supports efficient data handling and quick response times, making it suitable for applications with large volumes of data and frequent user interactions.

## Technology Stack
